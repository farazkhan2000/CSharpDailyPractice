# C# Beginner Practice

A simple console application where I practice C# fundamentals one small exercise at a time.

Every file contains one focused concept with a `Run()` method.  
A basic text menu in `Program.cs` lets me choose what to run without changing code every time.

### Current Topics & Exercises

**Basics**
- HelloWorld.cs  
- VariablesAndDataTypes.cs  
- MathOperations.cs  
- StringBasics.cs  

**Conditionals**
- IfElseSimple.cs  
- ElseIfLadder.cs  
- SwitchStatement.cs  
- TernaryOperator.cs  

**Loops**
- ForLoopBasics.cs  
- WhileLoop.cs  
- DoWhileLoop.cs  
- BreakAndContinue.cs  

### How to Run

1. Open the solution in Visual Studio  
2. Press **F5** (or click the green play button)  
3. Type the number of the exercise you want to see  
4. Press Enter  
5. After the exercise finishes → press any key to return to the menu  
6. Type **0** to exit

### Goals of this repo

- Learn C# basics step by step  
- Keep code very simple and easy to read  
- Practice daily (or regularly) and show progress

### Future Plans (coming soon)

- Methods folder  
- Arrays & Lists  
- Small console games (guessing game, calculator, etc.)  
- File reading/writing  
- Basic error handling  

Feel free to look around, fork it, or use any code as inspiration!
